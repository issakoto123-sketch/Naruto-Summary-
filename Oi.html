Here’s a very *long, detailed gist* of both Naruto and Naruto Shippuden—two interlinked parts of an epic ninja story created by Masashi Kishimoto. I’ll break it into major phases so you can follow the journey from start to finish: the original “Naruto” (often called Part I) and then “Naruto Shippuden” (Part II).  
Expect lots of characters, twists, battles, sacrifices, growth, and heart.

---

Part I: *Naruto*  
Origins & Early Life  
- In the Hidden Leaf Village (Konohagakure / Konoha) lives a boy named Naruto Uzumaki. From birth, he carries a heavy burden: the Nine‑Tailed Fox (Kurama) was sealed inside him by the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, at the cost of his life. [1]   
- Because of this, the villagers treat Naruto with suspicion, fear, or disdain—seeing him as an orphan, a trouble‑maker, and a “jinchūriki” (host of the beast). He grows up cast aside, hungry for attention and respect. [2]   
- Despite this, Naruto’s dream (his “Nindō” or ninja way) is very clear: he wants to become Hokage (the leader of the village) so that people will finally accept him, and he can prove his worth. [3]   

Training & Team 7
 After graduating from the Ninja Academy, Naruto is placed on Team 7 alongside Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha, under the guidance of sensei Kakashi Hatake. Sakura has a crush on Sasuke; Naruto is trying to win approval and also likes Sakura; Sasuke is driven by darker motives. [1]   
- Their early missions help them bond (and clash). For example, the Land of Waves arc where they escort a bridge‑builder and face the rogue ninja Zabuza and his protégé Haku. They face danger, realize the cost of ninja life, and grow.  

Chūnin Exams & Sasuke’s Departure  
- The Chūnin Exams arc: they face tough opponents, new rivals appear (like Gaara from the Sand Village). Hidden dangers emerge—enemy infiltration, tragedy.  
- During the exams, Orochimaru, a dangerous rogue ninja, attacks. Sasuke’s desire for power to avenge his clan pushes him further.  
- Eventually, Sasuke abandons Konoha to seek power from Orochimaru. Naruto, Sakura, and friends try to bring him back but fail. This event sets one of the biggest emotional threads: Naruto’s promise not to give up on his friend.  

Training & Growth  
- After Sasuke leaves, Naruto decides to train harder. He meets his mentor Jiraiya, begins to learn more advanced techniques, and starts understanding his own power and limitations.
The Akatsuki are revealed as major antagonists: they’re not just rogue ninjas—they’re after global chaos and control of the Tailed Beasts.  

Pain’s Assault & Village Devastation  
- One of the most pivotal moments: the leader of Akatsuki, known as Pain (Nagato), attacks Konoha. Buildings are destroyed, lives lost, including Naruto’s mentor Jiraiya. Naruto transforms (Sage Mode + Kurama) and fights back.  
- During the battle, Naruto reveals to the village his secret (he is the Nine‑Tails host). The village’s perception of him changes.  

Sasuke’s Path, Itachi’s Truth  
- Sasuke’s journey continues: he kills Itachi, learns the truth—that Itachi acted under orders from the village to prevent a coup. This revelation shakes Sasuke’s beliefs.  
- Naruto continues to hold onto hope that Sasuke can still come back to the fold.  

Fourth Great Ninja War  
- The war arc: All Five Great Shinobi Nations unite against Akatsuki. Major players: Madara Uchiha, revived Hokage, and eventually the ancient ancestor of all shinobi, Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. [5]   
- Naruto masters further powers. He bonds with Kurama, unlocks incredible new abilities—becoming a symbol of unity. Sasuke and Naruto fight side by side. Many sacrifices happen (Neji, Asuma, many others).  

Final Battle & Resolution
Sakura begins training under Tsunade. Sasuke travels his dark path. Meanwhile, Naruto deals with his inner conflicts (Kurama inside him), gets stronger, and matures.  

The Big Reveal & Final Clash  
- Old secrets begin surfacing: the Uchiha clan massacre, the identity of Itachi Uchiha (Sasuke’s brother), the truth behind many shinobi conspiracies.  
- Then the village is attacked by a massive force (including Sand + Leaf incident) and Konoha is nearly destroyed. Naruto steps up.  
- Sasuke and Naruto’s paths diverge further: Sasuke fights Itachi, learns the painful truth about his clan.  
- Ultimately, Part I ends with big promises: Naruto still chasing Sasuke; the world gearing up for greater threats; Naruto more determined than ever.  

---

Part II: *Naruto Shippuden*  
This picks up roughly 2½ years after Part I. Naruto returns stronger (after training with Jiraiya), ready for bigger battles. [4]   

Kazekage Rescue & Rising Threats  
- One of the first arcs: the Sand Village’s Kazekage Gaara is kidnapped by the criminal organization Akatsuki, who’re collecting all the Tailed Beasts. Naruto and the new Team 7 (with some new members) rush to save him.
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki – the origin of chakra; final major threat.  

---

Why It Matters  
- Naruto (Part I) set the stage: establishing world, characters, motivations.  
- Shippuden (Part II) escalates: bigger villains, deeper emotions, massive stakes.  
- Together they form a complete saga—from a young outcast ninja to world‑shaping hero.  
- The series shows that *your past doesn’t define your future*, *pain can lead to strength*, and *true bonds change everything*.

If you like, I can send you *an ultra‑long version* divided by arcs (Land of Waves Arc, Chūnin Exams Arc, Kazekage Rescue Arc, Pain’s Assault Arc, etc.) so you get each plotline in detail. Do you want that?
 The war ends with the defeat of Kaguya. Sasuke reveals his plan to revolutionize the world’s system, believing the shinobi world’s structures are flawed. Naruto and Sasuke fight one final time at the "Valley of the End."  
- Sasuke admits defeat, reforms. Naruto becomes Seventh Hokage. Peace returns.  

Themes & Growth  
- Throughout both series, key themes: *friendship*, *redemption*, *self‑acceptance*, *pain and healing*, *legacy*.  
- Naruto’s journey: from outcast → troublemaker → hero → leader. His growth is emotional as well as physical.  
- Sasuke’s journey: vengeance → truth → redemption.  
- The shinobi world: cycles of violence, but also hope and change.  
- Many characters get arcs: Gaara (from villain to Kazekage), Kakashi, Sakura, etc.
